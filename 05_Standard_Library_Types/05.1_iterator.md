# iterators in Rust

In Rust, iterators are a powerful and flexible abstraction for working with sequences of elements. They allow you to perform various operations on collections, in a concise and functional way. Iterators are lazy, meaning they only process elements as needed, which can lead to more efficient code.

Here's an explanation of some common iterator traits in Rust:

1. **Iterator Trait (`std::iter::Iterator`):**
   - This trait represents a sequence of elements that can be iterated over.
   - The core methods include `next()`, which returns an `Option` containing the next element or `None` if the iterator is exhausted.

2. **Iterator Adapters:**
   - These are methods that transform an iterator into another iterator, allowing you to chain operations.

3. **Consuming and Non-consuming Adapters:**
   - Consuming adapters consume the iterator, meaning you can only iterate through the sequence once.
   - Non-consuming adapters, on the other hand, produce a new iterator that doesn't consume the original.

Here's a simple example using a vector of numbers:
```rust
fn main() {
    // Create a vector of numbers
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Using iterator methods
    let sum: i32 = numbers.iter() // Create an iterator
        .filter(|&x| x % 2 == 0) // Filter even numbers
        .map(|x| x * 2) // Double each number
        .sum(); // Sum the results

    println!("Sum: {}", sum);
    // Output:
    // Sum: 12
}
```

Explanation:

- `.iter()`: Creates an iterator over the vector.
- `.filter()`: Filters out elements that don't satisfy the given condition (in this case, even numbers).
- `.map()`: Applies a function to each element (doubling each number).
- `.sum()`: Calculates the sum of all elements.

This example demonstrates the chaining of iterator methods to perform multiple operations on a collection in a concise and readable manner.

## Types of Iterators

In Rust, there are three main types of iterators: `iter()`, `iter_mut()`, and `into_iter()`. These methods provide different ways to iterate over collections, allowing you to borrow or consume elements in varying degrees.

### `iter()`: Immutable Borrowing Iterator

The `iter()` method returns an iterator that provides immutable references to the elements of a collection. This iterator allows you to iterate over the elements without modifying them, making it suitable for read-only operations.

Example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Create an iterator that borrows each element immutably
    for &num in numbers.iter() {
        println!("Number: {}", num);
    }
}
```

Here, `iter()` produces an iterator that borrows each element of the vector immutably, allowing us to print each number without modifying the original vector.

### `iter_mut()`: Mutable Borrowing Iterator

The `iter_mut()` method returns an iterator that provides mutable references to the elements of a collection. This iterator allows you to modify the elements while iterating over them.

Example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Create an iterator that borrows each element mutably
    for num in numbers.iter_mut() {
        *num *= 2; // Double each element
    }

    println!("Doubled Numbers: {:?}", numbers);
}
```

Here, `iter_mut()` produces an iterator that borrows each element mutably, enabling us to modify the original array by doubling each element.

### `into_iter()`: Consuming Iterator

The `into_iter()` method consumes the original collection, returning an iterator that takes ownership of its elements. This iterator is suitable for scenarios where you want to transfer ownership of the elements to another part of the code.

Example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // Create an iterator that consumes the vector
    for num in numbers.into_iter() {
        println!("Number: {}", num);
    }

    // 'numbers' vector is no longer accessible here, as it has been consumed
}
```

Here, `into_iter()` creates an iterator that consumes the vector, allowing us to print each number. After the loop, the original vector is no longer accessible because ownership has been transferred to the iterator.

> **Note:** By default the `for` loop will apply the `into_iter()` function to the collection. We don't have to use the `into_iter()` function to convert the collection to an iterator when using the for loop.

For example, these two ways to loop through an iterator are the same.
```rust
for num in numbers.into_iter() {
    // code
}

for num in numbers {
    // code
}
```

## `next()` Method of an Iterator

In Rust, the `next` method is a fundamental part of the iterator trait (`Iterator`). It is responsible for advancing the iterator and returning the next element in the sequence. The `next` method returns an `Option` that contains either the next element of the iterator if there is one, or `None` if the iterator has been exhausted.

### Syntax:

```rust
fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>
```

- `&mut self`: Indicates that the method may mutate the iterator by advancing its internal state.
- `-> Option<Self::Item>`: Specifies that the method returns an `Option` containing the next element (`Self::Item`) of the iterator, or `None` if the iterator is empty.

### Example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let mut iter = numbers.iter();

    // Advance the iterator and print each element
    loop {
        match iter.next() {
            Some(num) => println!("Next element: {}", num),
            None => break, // Exit loop when iterator is exhausted
        }
    }
}
```

### Output:

```
Next element: 1
Next element: 2
Next element: 3
Next element: 4
Next element: 5
```

Notice that we need to make the `iter` a mutable variable because calling `next()` will change the internal state of the iterator. Each call to `next()` will consume an item from the iterator. The `next()` method returns None when the iterator reaches the end of the sequence.

The `next()` method is crucial for iterating over collections in Rust, providing a way to access each element sequentially while efficiently handling cases where the iterator is empty.
